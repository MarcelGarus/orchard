# Never  
# Never is a type with zero instances. If you write a function that accepts an
# argument of Never, it can never be called (otherwise, the caller would have
# a Never instance).
# Why do we need something like this? Some expressions always abort control
# flow, for example `crash "Oh no!"`. These evaluate to the Never type. Because
# Never is never instantiated, it can be assigned to anything:
#
# some_bool = crash "Oh no!"

import "builtins".crash
export crash
