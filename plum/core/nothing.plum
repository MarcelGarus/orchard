# Nothing (aka Unit or Void)
# Nothing is a type with only one instance. From an information theoretical
# perspective, being given an instance of a Nothing type gives you no
# information whatsoever. The size of a Nothing instance is zero â€“ it disappears
# at compile time! Like a ghost!
# Functions without an explicit return type return Nothing by default. Functions
# that don't have anything useful to return (such as print) return Nothing
# instead. Empty bodies return Nothing.
